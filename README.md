# Bug Squish
This is a quick and simple 30 second game with the objective of squishing as many bugs as possible before the timer runs out.<br />
<br />
Bug sprites were drawn in Microsoft Paint, p5.js was used to implement the user interface, and tone.js for the sound effects and music.<br />
<br />
A challenge that I faced when creating this game was preventing the player from squishing bugs after the game was over from behind the end game screen, ultimately reaching the max amount of points.<br />
<br />
No further updates will be made to this project.<br />

<b>How to play the game:</b><br />
Gameplay is simple. Bugs run across the screen and can be squished by clicking on them.
